## Eventor

The Eventor project on Github is divided into 2 branches:

* Master. 

* Mockup. 

### Master. 


The Master contains the all the Backend functionality of the app.  

It is the default you get when download the project. 

### Mockup. 

Even though the Mockup was derived from the Master branch, Mockup remains the most complete out of the part. The Eventor project is currently running on the Mockup branch: [dev-eventor.herokuapp.com](https://dev-eventor.herokuapp.com)
